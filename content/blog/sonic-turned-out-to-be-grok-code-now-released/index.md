Just last week, we were all [talking about Sonic](/posts/the-sonic-new-model-is-really-good), a new stealth model that appeared in Cursor. Today, we got confirmation that this is indeed, Grok Code Fast 1.

It's already available in all editors (Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, OpenCode, most have annouced it), some of them even have it available for free for a limited time.

The model has two things that stand out:
* It is the fastest model that can do tool calls reliably (without using something like [Groq](https://groq.com/) inference)
* It is priced at [$0.2/m in and $1.5/m out](https://docs.x.ai/docs/models/grok-code-fast-1), with prompt caching available.

**This model is 10 times cheaper than Sonnet 4, and 6 times cheaper than GPT-5, and faster than both of them**. This means you can get way more out whatever editor subscription you have.

I'm very excited about this model. I still need to do some more serious work with it, but if it's good enough, if may become my default, until I need the other models for more complex stuff.
